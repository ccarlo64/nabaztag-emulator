Nabaztag emulator for Karotz
2015 v 001

prerequisite: Openkarotz

set variables MAC and H with your mac address and your server OJN
in the script
copy the files in '/ usr / openkarotz / Extra /' with ftp or the way you want
if you change the folder name must also customize the variable SCRIPT

add your Karotz server OJN
connect to telnet to Karotz
go to the folder '/ usr / openkarotz / Extra /'
and run python s004.py
.. Wait a few seconds
if all goes well you will see 'Authentication complete ....'

go to set the plugin server OJN:-)

obviously not all work (would be nice) but something already goes ..
