2021
Adapted the emulator to work on the basis of https://www.freerabbits.nl/

simplified installation:
- create a fat32 formatted usb key
- extract the contents of the zip file inside
- insert it into the karotz
- turn on the karotz
the installation is short, then it will start the normal boot of the rabbit and immediately after it will connect to the openjabnab server based on the zip version chosen

the freerabbit functions are disabled but if you continue to use it and add app / time everything will get mixed up a bit ...

this should disable the emulator

this should re-enable the emulator
